### 2. Image Encryption Tool

#### Description
This project is an image encryption tool developed as part of Task 02 assigned by Prodigy Infotech. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques. By swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations, the tool ensures that the images are securely encrypted and can be accurately decrypted. The graphical user interface, built with tkinter, makes it user-friendly and easy to navigate.

#### Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language used for developing the tool.
- tkinter: A Python library used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- PIL (Pillow): A Python Imaging Library used for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.
- os: A module for interacting with the operating system to handle file paths and directories.
- random: A module for generating random numbers, used in the pixel swapping algorithm.

#### Features
- Image Selection and Display: Users can select an image file (JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF) from their system and preview it within the application.
- Encryption: The tool encrypts images by randomly swapping pixel values multiple times, ensuring a scrambled and secure output.
- Decryption: The tool decrypts images by reversing the pixel swapping process, accurately reconstructing the original image.
- File Saving: Users can choose a directory to save the encrypted or decrypted image, with the application automatically generating appropriate filenames.
- User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive GUI allows users to easily navigate through the encryption and decryption process, providing clear buttons and labels for each action.
