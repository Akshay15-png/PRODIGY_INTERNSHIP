### 2. Image Encryption Tool

#### Description
This project is an image encryption tool developed as part of Task 02 assigned by Prodigy Infotech. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques. By swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations, the tool ensures that the images are securely encrypted and can be accurately decrypted. The graphical user interface, built with tkinter, makes it user-friendly and easy to navigate.

#### Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language used for developing the tool.
- tkinter: A Python library used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- PIL (Pillow): A Python Imaging Library used for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.
- os: A module for interacting with the operating system to handle file paths and directories.
- random: A module for generating random numbers, used in the pixel swapping algorithm.

#### Features
- Image Selection and Display: Users can select an image file (JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF) from their system and preview it within the application.
- Encryption: The tool encrypts images by randomly swapping pixel values multiple times, ensuring a scrambled and secure output.
- Decryption: The tool decrypts images by reversing the pixel swapping process, accurately reconstructing the original image.
- File Saving: Users can choose a directory to save the encrypted or decrypted image, with the application automatically generating appropriate filenames.
- User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive GUI allows users to easily navigate through the encryption and decryption process, providing clear buttons and labels for each action.

### 3. Password Complexity Checker

#### Description
This project is a password complexity checker developed as part of an assignment by Prodigy Infotech. The tool allows users to assess the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, it checks if the password is present in a predefined wordlist and estimates the time it would take to crack the password using brute force methods. The graphical user interface, built with tkinter, makes it user-friendly and easy to navigate.

#### Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language used for developing the tool.
- tkinter: A Python library used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- PIL (Pillow): A Python Imaging Library used for handling and displaying the logo image.
- re: A module for regular expression matching operations.
- os: A module for interacting with the operating system to handle file paths and directories.

#### Features
- Password Input and Display: Users can enter a password and check its complexity within the application.
- Criteria-Based Complexity Assessment: The tool checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in the password.
- Time to Crack Estimation: The tool estimates the time required to crack the password based on its complexity.
- Wordlist Check: The tool checks if the password is present in a predefined wordlist and adjusts the complexity assessment accordingly.
- Feedback on Password Strength: The tool provides feedback on the password's strength, categorizing it as "Very Weak", "Weak", "Medium", "Strong", or "Out of the world".
- User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive GUI allows users to easily navigate through the password complexity checking process, providing clear buttons and labels for each action.

### 4. Keystroke Logger

#### Description
This project is a keystroke logger developed to capture and log keystrokes from a keyboard in real-time. It records each keystroke, including special keys, and saves them to a text file (logs.txt). The script uses the Python keyboard library to capture keystrokes globally, allowing it to work across different applications and windows. Each keystroke is timestamped and logged with a human-readable representation for special keys to enhance clarity.

#### Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language for capturing and logging keystrokes.
- keyboard library: Python library for capturing keyboard events.
- datetime: Python module for generating timestamps.

#### Features
- Real-Time Keystroke Logging: Captures keystrokes in real-time and logs them to logs.txt.
- Timestamps: Timestamped with the current date and time.
- Special Key Handling: Converts special keys (e.g., space, enter) into human-readable representations for clearer logging.
- File Handling: Uses with open to append keystrokes to logs.txt.
- User Notification: Provides feedback to the user when keystrokes are being captured.
